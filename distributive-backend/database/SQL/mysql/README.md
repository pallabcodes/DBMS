## New Structure

The new MySQL structure follows the same pattern as PostgreSQL and SQL Server:

```
mysql/
├── core/                    # Core concepts
├── advanced/                # Advanced topics
│   └── enterprise-patterns/ # Enterprise patterns (NEW)
├── industry-niches/         # Industry-specific schemas
└── templates/              # Templates and utilities
    └── simulation-schemas/ # Simulation schemas (NEW)
```

## Please Use

**`/references/system-design/mysql/`** for all MySQL content.

This directory is kept for reference only and may be removed in the future.
