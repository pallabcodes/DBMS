A Vision-Language Model (VLM) is a type of artificial intelligence that can see and talk about what it sees — in a unified way rather than as two separate skills. Traditional AI used to be split: some models were good at language (“read this sentence and answer questions”), and others good at vision (“look at this image and identify objects”). VLMs bring those together in one brain-like system.
