# Redis Single Instance Architecture

## Process Architecture

A single Redis server process is designed for maximum efficiency in in-memory data storage and retrieval:

- Single-threaded event loop model
- Processes 50,000-100,000 operations per second
- Optimized for minimal latency
- CPU core bound due to single-threaded nature

## Instance Characteristics

- One redis-server process = One Redis instance = One shard
- Memory-first architecture
- Non-blocking I/O operations
- Event-driven processing

## Performance Expectations

On standard hardware (e.g., i3 CPU, 16GB RAM):
- 50,000-100,000 requests per second for simple operations
- Sub-millisecond response times
- Memory-bound rather than CPU-bound for most operations

## Resource Requirements

- Memory: Primarily dependent on dataset size
- CPU: Single core utilization
- Network: Low latency requirements
- Storage: Optional, based on persistence configuration

## Limitations

1. Single-threaded architecture constraints
2. Memory capacity limits
3. Vertical scaling limitations
4. Single point of failure without replication

## Best Practices

1. Monitor memory usage
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Use appropriate data structures
4. Configure persistence based on requirements
5. Implement proper backup strategies
