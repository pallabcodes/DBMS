# Redis Scaling Patterns and Anti-Patterns

## Recommended Patterns

### 1. Pipeline Operations
- Batch multiple commands
- Reduce network roundtrips
- Optimize throughput
- Memory efficiency

### 2. Connection Pooling
- Reuse connections
- Reduce connection overhead
- Manage connection lifecycle
- Optimize resource usage

### 3. Key Management
- Use UNLINK instead of DEL for large keys
- Implement proper TTL strategies
- Use hash tags for related keys
- Optimize key size and structure

### 4. Monitoring and Optimization
- Implement slow log monitoring
- Track memory usage
- Monitor network metrics
- Analyze command patterns

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Operations
❌ Using KEYS * in production
❌ Storing large values (>10KB)
❌ Missing TTLs on cache keys
❌ Inefficient data structures

### 2. Architecture
❌ Single point of failure
❌ Missing monitoring
❌ Improper sharding
❌ Inadequate memory planning

### 3. Development
❌ Missing error handling
❌ Improper connection management
❌ Lack of timeout handling
❌ Insufficient logging
