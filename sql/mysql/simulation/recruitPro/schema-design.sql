## Step 1: Brainstorming Database Requirements & Challenges

### 1. Core Entities
- **Candidates**: Personal info, skills, experience, education, status, privacy.
- **Employers/Clients**: Google, Stripe, Amazon, PayPal, etc.
- **Jobs/Positions**: Job details, requirements, status.
- **Applications**: Candidate applications to jobs, status, history.
- **Recruiters/Users**: Internal users managing the process.
- **Events/Logs**: Auditing, tracking changes, compliance.

### 2. Key Challenges
- **Scalability**: Millions of candidates, jobs, applications.
- **Data Integrity**: Prevent duplicates, ensure referential integrity.
- **Performance**: Fast search/filtering, indexing, partitioning.
- **Security & Privacy**: GDPR, CCPA, access control, audit trails.
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new fields/entities.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Efficient aggregation, historical data.
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple clients with data isolation.

### 3. Schema Design Principles
- **Normalization**: Avoid redundancy, ensure consistency.
- **Indexing**: On search/filter columns (e.g., skills, status).
- **Partitioning**: By client, region, or time for large tables.
- **Foreign Keys**: Enforce relationships, cascading actions.
- **Audit Tables**: For compliance and debugging.
- **Enum/Reference Tables**: For statuses, types, etc.

## Step 2: High-Level Entity Relationship

- Candidates <-> Applications <-> Jobs <-> Employers
- Recruiters manage Candidates/Jobs/Applications
- Events/Logs track changes/actions

---

## Step 3: Next Steps

1. **Define core tables and their relationships.**
2. **Decide on key fields, indexes, and constraints.**
3. **Document design choices and rationale.**
