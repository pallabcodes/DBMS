-- # SUB QUERY : A subquery is a query nested within another query. A subquery is also known as an inner query or nested query.
-- Where to use subquery (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP, HAVING)

-- # Regular Subquery

SELECT name, (SELECT MAX(list_price) FROM products WHERE category_id = 1) AS max_price
FROM categories;

-- Find the country_id for the country = 'United States';
SELECT country_id
from country
where country = 'United States';

-- Second, retrieve cities from the city table where country_id is 103:
SELECT city
FROM city
WHERE country_id = 103
ORDER BY city;

-- basic subquery: Instead of executing two queries, you can combine them into one, making the first query as a subquery and the second query as the main query as follows
SELECT city
FROM city
WHERE country_id = (
    -- SUBQUERY STARTS
    SELECT country_id
    FROM country
    WHERE country = 'United States'
    -- SUBQUERY ENDS
)
ORDER BY city;

select *
from category;

-- Here, just dong `INNER JOIN` so based on the category.category_id matches with whichever film_id pick that
SELECT film_id
FROM film_category
         INNER JOIN category using (category_id)
WHERE name = 'Action';

-- Second, use the query above as a subquery to retrieve the film title from the film table:

-- Using subquery with IN
SELECT film_id,
       title,
       rating,
       length
FROM film
WHERE film_id IN (SELECT film_id
                  FROM film_category
                           INNER JOIN category USING (category_id)
                  WHERE name = 'Action')
ORDER BY film_id;

-- # Correlated Subquery: a correlated subquery is a subquery that references the columns from the outer query.

select film_id, title, length, rating
from film;

-- 1. The outer query retrieves film_id, title, length, rating from film f, and it has film_id (1), title (Action Movie 1), length(120), rating (PG-13)
-- 2. For each row processed by the outer query, the correlated subquery calculates the average length of films that have the same rating as the current row (f.rating) meaning
-- 3. For e.g. when at the first row film_id (1), rating (PG-13), go to subquery and find from tables that `PG-13` here it has 2 rows so get avg((120+110)/2) = 110
-- 4. since, outer query's length i.e. 120 greater so the currently outer row is applicable to part of the output


SELECT film_id, title, length, rating
FROM film f
WHERE length > (SELECT AVG(length)
                FROM film
                WHERE rating = f.rating);

select *
from employees;
select *

-- 1) Using ANY operator with the = operator example (so salary exist on both employees and managers and so whichever salary from manager matched in employees, pick that)
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary = ANY (SELECT salary FROM managers);

-- 2) Using ANY operator with > operator example (so salary exist on both employees and managers and as it goes over each employee and then look for salary within manager if it is greater than current row's employees salary then pick it )
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM managers);

-- 3) Using ANY operator with < operator example : The following example uses the ANY operator to find employees who have salaries less than the managerâ€™s salaries:
-- This query finds all employees whose salary is less than at least one other salary in the employees table.
-- It uses the ANY operator to compare each salary with the set of all salaries.
-- The largest salary is excluded because it cannot be less than any other salary.
-- 45000, 55000, 50000, 48000, 52000, 49000, 53000, 47000, 56000, 44000, 59000, 42000 : which is why 59000 excluded since it's highest (no greater amount in employees than this)
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary < ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees);
-- It returns all the rows with the employee type because they have a value in the salary column less than any value in the set (55K, 58K, and 60K).

-- # ALL Operator

SELECT *
